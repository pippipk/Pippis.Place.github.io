        <h1>Relevant Implications</h1>
        <P>-   We have future proofed the design of this program. Future Proofing means the program is designed so new features can be added easily and the old ones easily removed.
            <br><br>
            -   We have been adding things this whole time, in each of the sprints. We addressed this in the way the programme has been designed.
            <br><br>
            -   Program elements (colours, buttons and shapes) have all been programed as objects. This means each object is a self contained module piece of code that takes a defined set of parameters to work. Most take basic mouse data and colours to work. All objects are built to a similar structure and compulsorily contain an update function. This means they can appear on the interface using the update call. Management of most of the objects happens in a central place (Control Object). The idea is if you give the program to someone else (an experienced programmer), they could interpret what it does and built a new component. They could remove features and add new features. 
            <br><br>
            -   Comments in the code are precise and informative. 
            </P><hr>

    <h1>Product Backlog: </h1>
        <p>This is my list of idea for things I am hoping to create or build into my program in this assessment. I likely will not be able to implement all of these into my program but this is bountiful list to choose from. Some things I might try out and find they don't work very well for my specific program, i.e rotating or animation for a drawing program may not work, and some things I may find too hard to code.</p>

    <h1>Sprint One: </h1>
    <p>My aim for this first sprint is to have a defined drawing box on the canvas. When the user down drags in this area, the bounding box shows the boundary defined by MouseStart and current Mouse coordinates, using my rectangle function developed in the developing stage. When the rectangle is released a coloured rectangle stays on the screen.<br></p>
    <p> I will <span class="bold">thoroughly </span> comment the code!</p>
    <h3>My Trello plan </h3>

    <div><img class="imgSizer" src="box.jpg"></div>
        <p> This second test explores how the bounding box appears when I click and drag in and out of the rectangle.<br>
        This could be a bit more user friendly by staying at the boundary if the user drags outside , 
        but this is a reasonable working version for now.

    <p>My aim is to more colour swatches (colour squares).<br>

        <h1>Fifth Sprint: </h1>
        <p>My aim is to create more shapes to draw in the program. I will make a heart, circle, line, and triangle function. I will also be doing some basic reformatting to fit in more buttons for these extra shapes. I will have separate rows for the colour buttons and the shape buttons.<br>
            <br>
            I will now have a shippable product with <span class="bold">six </span>colours and <span class="bold">six </span> shapes.

        <div><img class="imgSizer" src="sprintFive.jpg"></div>
        <h3> Testing </h3>
        <p> The first shape I made for this sprint was the circle. I thought the circle would be the most simple as it is very similar to an ellipse. However the circle was the most challenging. It was very difficult to make the circle (with any radius) appear in the outline box, let alone, the centre of this box. </p>

            <p> The second shape I made was a triangle. This turned out to be the easiest shape to make in this sprint. Note: The triangle does appear upside down if the outline box height is negative, however I think this makes a cool drawing feature so there is more variation of the triangles' appearence. Triangles can be upside down and still be a triangle.

                </video></div>
            <p> This next, tests if the heart function is working correctly. I also had some small errors with this shape. It would probably be good to make the heart not be able to be upside down, as hearts are never upside down. I will fix this using the absolute value function. 
                </p>

                <p> Reflection: I would like to change the line function, and changing the outline to make it clearer that the function is drawing a line rather than a rectangle. I would like to create more of a brush function rather than a 'line'. It would nice if it draws while the user drags on the screen. So the drawing would need to pushed when the mouse is down rather than when the mouse comes up.

                This will let the user remove a shape, or all the shapes, from the screen. I will also change the button of the line function to a brush image. I will reformat and create button graphics. I will add more colours and make my original colours brighter.</p>

            <p>Reflection: I created the buttons for the change background color functions in this sprint when I will not be adding the code to make these buttons work until a few sprints later. Reflecting, this may not have been the best way to do this as this could be potentially confusing. However, it made sense to create the buttons as I did a lot of reformatting for the colour buttons so I added these buttons in, deciding to do all the formatting and layout of buttons on the screen now, rather than having to do some now and change it in a later sprint when I decided to add these buttons in. It can still be seen however, that by the end of this sprint the formatting has not been completed as some of the shape buttons and brush button are messy and over lapping. This will be changed in the following sprints. All the buttons work so I decided to finish this sprint. In the next sprints, as well as adding new features, these problems should be fixed. Another problem is the text on the screen, it is not centred. </p>

            <h1>Seventh Sprint: </h1>
            <p>My aim for this sprint is make the line button draw like a brush when the mouse goes down. I will create a circle where the mouse is and more circles will be pushed when the brush moves creating a brush stroke effect.<br></p>
            <h3>My Trello plan </h3>
            <div><img class="imgSizer" src="sprintSeven.jpg"></div>
            <h3> Testing </h3>
            <p> First I am testing a hover feature created for the brush function to show the user where they are about to draw on the screen. This circle follows the users mouse in boundary box.   
            </p>
            <div class="vid_div"><video width="800"  controls>

                </video>
            </div>

            <p> Here I am testing my new brush function that allows the user to free hand draw on the boundary box. The user uses the slider to set the width of the brush.  
            </p>
            <div class="vid_div"><video width="800"  controls>

                </video>
            </div>

            <p> An error I have is when the user draws they can draw past the edge of the bounds box. This is because the mouse is in the centre of the drawing circle so the mouse isn't crossing the bound but the drawings do.   
            </p>
            <div><img class="imgSizer2" src="clip.jpg">

            <div><img class="imgSizer2" src="clip2.jpg"></div>

            <p>I have made the brush image get bigger when it is selected. This shows the user they have selected the brush button and that they can draw with it. The size changes back when it is no longer selected. I have finished this sprint.</p>

            <p>Reflection:  I think the puprle and yellow work well as the base colours for the workspace as they are muted and classic, allowing the user's drawing to stand out on screen. One problem I have is the brush guide does not appear in the drawing box until the mouse goes down once, this is managable for the user though. The brush function is not perfect, as when the user moves the mouse too fast we can see it pushes circles too slow and there are gaps in the stroke. However, if the user doesn't move the mouse too fast this problem should unnoticed and should be okay.</p>

            <h1>Eighth Sprint: </h1>
        <p>My aim for this sprint is to create a redo button. This will let the user redo what they have undoed with the undo button. I will also loop some of my code in the main to make my code more managable and readable. This will also make the code easier to change or to have something added to it. <br>
            <br>
            I will be adding <span class="bold"> thorough </span> comments to my code.

        <p> I have increased the size of the brush image when it is selected to show the user when it is selected.  </p>

            <p> For this second test, I changed the text for the white button from white to grey, as the white was difficult to read against the faint yellow background. The improves the user's experience and interface.

            <p> This next, tests the redo button. The basic implimentation of this works, however it can be seen that at the end of the test I ran into an error. The redo button pushed the wrong shape onto the screen and then the program crashed.

        <p>My aim is to add the line function back in. This will also take the length from the slider<br>

        <p> The first shape I made for this sprint was the circle. I thought the circle would be the most simple as it is very similar to an ellipse. However the circle was the most challenging. It was very difficult to make the circle (with any radius) appear in the outline box, let alone, the centre of this box. </p>

            <p> The second shape I made was a triangle. This turned out to be the easiest shape to make in this sprint. Note: The triangle does appear upside down if the outline box height is negative, however I think this makes a cool drawing feature so there is more variation of the triangles' appearence. Triangles can be upside down and still be a triangle.

            <p> This next, tests if the heart function is working correctly. I also had some small errors with this shape. It would probably be good to make the heart not be able to be upside down, as hearts are never upside down. I will fix this using the absolute value function.

                <p> Reflection: I would like to change the line function, and changing the outline to make it clearer that the function is drawing a line rather than a rectangle. I would like to create more of a brush function rather than a 'line'. It would nice if it draws while the user drags on the screen. So the drawing would need to pushed when the mouse is down rather than when the mouse comes up.
