    <h1>Sprint One: </h1>
    <p>My aim for this first sprint is to have a defined drawing box on the canvas. When the user down drags in this area, the bounding box shows the boundary defined by MouseStart and current Mouse coordinates, using my rectangle function developed in the developing stage. When the rectangle is released a coloured rectangle stays on the screen.<br></p>
    <p> I will <span class="bold">thoroughly </span> comment the code!</p>
    <h3>My Trello plan </h3>
    <div><img class="imgSizer" src="sprintOne.jpg"></div>
    <h3> Testing </h3>
    <p> This first test uses console logging to test if my boundary function is working properly.</p>
    <div><img class="imgSizer" src="box.jpg"></div>
        <p> This second test explores how the bounding box appears when I click and drag in and out of the rectangle.<br>
        This could be a bit more user friendly by staying at the boundary if the user drags outside , 
        but this is a reasonable working version for now.

        <h1>Second Sprint: </h1>
        <p>My aim is to create an ellipse shape to draw on the canvas.<br>
            Later I will combine this with the draw rectangle function to have a program that can draw multiple shapes. This will give me a potentially shippable product of <span class="bold">two </span>features.

    <h1>Third Sprint: </h1>
    
    <p>My aim is to more colour swatches (colour squares).<br>
        This will allow the user to select a colour for the shape and that will set the rectangle colour variable.
        This will now give me a potentially shippable product that has choices for colour.

        <h1>Fifth Sprint: </h1>
        <p>My aim is to create more shapes to draw in the program. I will make a heart, circle, line, and triangle function. I will also be doing some basic reformatting to fit in more buttons for these extra shapes. I will have separate rows for the colour buttons and the shape buttons.<br>
            <br>
            I will now have a shippable product with <span class="bold">six </span>colours and <span class="bold">six </span> shapes.

        <div><img class="imgSizer" src="sprintFive.jpg"></div>
        <h3> Testing </h3>
        <p> The first shape I made for this sprint was the circle. I thought the circle would be the most simple as it is very similar to an ellipse. However the circle was the most challenging. It was very difficult to make the circle (with any radius) appear in the outline box, let alone, the centre of this box. </p>

            <p> The second shape I made was a triangle. This turned out to be the easiest shape to make in this sprint. Note: The triangle does appear upside down if the outline box height is negative, however I think this makes a cool drawing feature so there is more variation of the triangles' appearence. Triangles can be upside down and still be a triangle.

            <p> This next, tests if the heart function is working correctly. I also had some small errors with this shape. It would probably be good to make the heart not be able to be upside down, as hearts are never upside down. I will fix this using the absolute value function. 
                </p>

                </video></div>
                <p> Reflection: I would like to change the line function, and changing the outline to make it clearer that the function is drawing a line rather than a rectangle. I would like to create more of a brush function rather than a 'line'. It would nice if it draws while the user drags on the screen. So the drawing would need to pushed when the mouse is down rather than when the mouse comes up.

            <h1>Sixth Sprint: </h1>
            <p>My aim for this sprint is to create an undo and clear all button.<br>
                This will let the user remove a shape, or all the shapes, from the screen. I will also change the button of the line function to a brush image. I will reformat and create button graphics. I will add more colours and make my original colours brighter.</p>

            <p>Reflection: I created the buttons for the change background color functions in this sprint when I will not be adding the code to make these buttons work until a few sprints later. Reflecting, this may not have been the best way to do this as this could be potentially confusing. However, it made sense to create the buttons as I did a lot of reformatting for the colour buttons so I added these buttons in, deciding to do all the formatting and layout of buttons on the screen now, rather than having to do some now and change it in a later sprint when I decided to add these buttons in. It can still be seen however, that by the end of this sprint the formatting has not been completed as some of the shape buttons and brush button are messy and over lapping. This will be changed in the following sprints. All the buttons work so I decided to finish this sprint. In the next sprints, as well as adding new features, these problems should be fixed. Another problem is the text on the screen, it is not centred. </p>

            <h1>Seventh Sprint: </h1>
            <p>My aim for this sprint is make the line button draw like a brush when the mouse goes down. I will create a circle where the mouse is and more circles will be pushed when the brush moves creating a brush stroke effect.<br></p>
            <h3>My Trello plan </h3>
            <div><img class="imgSizer" src="sprintSeven.jpg"></div>
            <h3> Testing </h3>
            <p> First I am testing a hover feature created for the brush function to show the user where they are about to draw on the screen. This circle follows the users mouse in boundary box.   
            </p>
            <div class="vid_div"><video width="800"  controls>
                <source src="brushMouse.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                Your browser does not support the video tag.
                </video>
            </div>

            <p> Here I am testing my new brush function that allows the user to free hand draw on the boundary box. The user uses the slider to set the width of the brush.  
            </p>
            <div class="vid_div"><video width="800"  controls>
                <source src="end.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                Your browser does not support the video tag.
                </video>
            </div>

            <p> An error I have is when the user draws they can draw past the edge of the bounds box. This is because the mouse is in the centre of the drawing circle so the mouse isn't crossing the bound but the drawings do.   
            </p>
            <div><img class="imgSizer2" src="clip.jpg">
            </div>
            <p>I will use the clip function to fix this.</p>
            <div><img class="imgSizer2" src="clip2.jpg"></div>

            <p>I have made the brush image get bigger when it is selected. This shows the user they have selected the brush button and that they can draw with it. The size changes back when it is no longer selected. I have finished this sprint.</p>
            <div class="vid_div"><video width="800"  controls>

                Your browser does not support the video tag.
                </video>
            </div>
            <p>Reflection:  I think the puprle and yellow work well as the base colours for the workspace as they are muted and classic, allowing the user's drawing to stand out on screen. One problem I have is the brush guide does not appear in the drawing box until the mouse goes down once, this is managable for the user though. The brush function is not perfect, as when the user moves the mouse too fast we can see it pushes circles too slow and there are gaps in the stroke. However, if the user doesn't move the mouse too fast this problem should unnoticed and should be okay.</p>

            <h1>Eighth Sprint: </h1>
        <p>My aim for this sprint is to create a redo button. This will let the user redo what they have undoed with the undo button. I will also loop some of my code in the main to make my code more managable and readable. This will also make the code easier to change or to have something added to it. <br>
            <br>
            I will be adding <span class="bold"> thorough </span> comments to my code.

        <h3> Testing </h3>
        <p> I have created a redo button.  It is able to redo the first few times I push it then the program crashes. </p>
        <div class="vid_div"><video width="800"  controls>
                <source src="redo1.mp4.mov" type="video/mp4">
                Your browser does not support the video tag.
                </video></div>
            <p> I have also changed the text colour of the white text to grey so it is easier to read for the user.   
            </p>
            <div class="vid_div"><video width="800"  controls>
                <source src="whitetext.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                Your browser does not support the video tag.
                </video></div>
            <p> This next, tests the redo button again. The basic implimentation of this works, however it can be seen that at the end of the test I ran into an error. The redo button pushed the wrong shape onto the screen and then the program crashed. 
                </p>
                <div class="vid_div"><video width="800"  controls>
                    <source src="redobuttontest.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                    Your browser does not support the video tag.
                    </video></div>
            <p> This next test, tests the redo function. The program did not crash but the right shapes did not appear on the screen. 
            </p>
            <div class="vid_div"><video width="800"  controls>
                <source src="redo2.mp4.mov" type="video/mp4">
                Your browser does not support the video tag.
                </video></div>

                <p> In this next test, it is apparent that another error I encountered was the shapes disappearing when the colour was changed. 
                </p>
                <div class="vid_div"><video width="800"  controls>
                    <source src="redo.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                    Your browser does not support the video tag.
                    </video></div>

                <p> This last test, shows that redo is near complete and will work for a user's experience with my program. 
                </p>
                <div class="vid_div"><video width="800"  controls>
                    <source src="lastredo.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                    Your browser does not support the video tag.
                    </video></div>

            <p>Here is a screenshot of the buttons I have looped in the main. I have not looped the shape buttons as they all have very different parameteres so a loop would not work. I have looped the colour buttons and the extra buttons (undo and clear all).</p>
            <div><img class="imgSizer" src="looped.jpg"></div>
            <p>Reflection: I am proud that I was able to get my redo button to work after much time and lots of effort! I have encountered some errors after pushing the buttons over 10 times or so in a row, however as it is extremely unlikely a user will do this and the program does not crash I am happy with the redo button and am ready to move on to my next sprint. However with the amount of errors I am encountering it may not worth to keep pursuring the redo button.  </p>

            <h1>Ninth Sprint: </h1>
        <p>My aim is to add the line function back in. This will also take the length from the slider. I will impliment functions for the change background colour option so the user can change the yellow background to any of the other colour optiions. <br>
            <br>
</p>

        <div><img class="imgSizer" src="SPRINT9.jpg"></div>
        <h3> Testing </h3>
        <p> I have added the line function back in and used a pencil image for as the button. This works similarly to the brush button. It is able to take the width from the slider and changes color too.</p>
        <div class="vid_div"><video width="800"  controls>

                </video></div>
                <p>I have changed the color sent to the control object when the white button is selected for the brush. This means the color comes as white, the color selected, and not the outline color of grey. This improves the functionality of my program.

            <p> This last test, tests if I have finished my sprint.

                <p> Reflection: I have confident that I have finished this sprint. Within this sprint, there were no apparent bugs that appeared and so I am confident my program is bug free. I have taken out the change background color option button (which was a button that did not do anything yet) while formatting my pencil button in to increase space for more important features such as this line button and more room for the slider. I think that graphics of the pencil and brush button look good together.

            <h1>Tenth Sprint: </h1>
        <p> This is my last sprint in my program. By the end of this sprint my program should be finished. I plan to do my final tests and checks in this sprint. I will be adding the change background color of the drawing box feature in this final sprint. This will allow the user to change the background color to increase drawing features. The user will also be able to change the color back to the original. I will be adding final <span class="bold">thorough</span> code comments. <br>

        <div><img class="imgSizer" src="sprintTen.jpg"></div>
        <h3> Testing </h3>
        <p> I have made the change background color function. This test shows when the button is selected the background color changes to the color already selected.</p>
        <div class="vid_div"><video width="800"  controls>
                <source src="background.mp4" type="video/mp4">

                </video></div>
            <p> This is how I have created and formatted the buttons for this feature. They sit with the color buttons so the user knows that the color selected will be the color of the background. 
            </p>
            <div><img class="imgSizer2" src="ten.jpg"></div>
            <p> This test, tests the background change function as well as the program as a whole as a final check for bugs or errors.

                <p> Reflection: I would like to change the line function, and changing the outline to make it clearer that the function is drawing a line rather than a rectangle. I would like to create more of a brush function rather than a 'line'. It would nice if it draws while the user drags on the screen. So the drawing would need to pushed when the mouse is down rather than when the mouse comes up.
